            <h2 class="text-primary text-3xl font-semibold">DMCA</h2>
            <p class="text-primary text-opacity-75">The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States copyright
                law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

                The DMCA criminalizes the production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services that are
                primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing technological measures that effectively
                control access to copyrighted works.

                The DMCA also provides a safe harbor for online service providers from copyright infringement liability,
                provided that they meet certain conditions, such as promptly removing infringing material upon notification.

                If you believe that your copyright has been infringed, you can file a DMCA takedown notice with the online
                service provider that is hosting the infringing material.</p>
